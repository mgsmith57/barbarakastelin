            <p>My next novel will be about a woman selling flowers in London.</p>
            <p>As this is not just shaken out of my sleeve, and I need to acquaint myself with the heroine in my imagination, and find out who she will meet, I am concurrently working on a collection of short stories, just to keep writing being written.</p>
            <p>These short stories play in different parts of the world and, only too often, reveal the darker side of human nature.</p>
